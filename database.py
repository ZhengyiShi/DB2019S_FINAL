#This allows a user to search for 1 of four specific measures and provide either:
    -ZIP code
    -State (specified by leaving zip and city empty)
    -City and State (specified by leaving zip empty)
    -No location (specified by leaving the prompts empty)
    Providing a ZIP gives an exact location, so state/city are skipped, and you can access the nOtherwise
    by leaving the field blank when prompted
And choose to order their query by
    -alphabetical order of hospital name
    -cheapest/most expensive
    -least/most safe

PROCEDURE:
1. Get inputs from user realted to location,medical procedure, and sort order
2. Build SQL query out of destq,payq,compq,and orderq
3. Execute query and return/print
